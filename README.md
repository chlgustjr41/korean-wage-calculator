### Description
A website to make wage calculation easier in Korea! While wage calculation with only **wage x time** is simple, Korea has a special policy called **Holiday Allowance** that provide additional free work hours to the workers who worked more than 15 hours a week. Also, Korea also considers extra payment for **late night work hour** after 10 PM. This website considers all of the wage calculations above and simplifies it by just entering individual worker's work hours!

### Note
While the main wage calculation functionalities are valid and available, the website is still in development for better user experience with new upcoming features and English translation.
